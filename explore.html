                        We live in a world in which systemic cruelty, discrimination, violence, and poverty are pervasive. Sometimes we ourselves suffer at the hands of these injustices, and other times it is the suffering of others that we face. There are days when being “awake” to the truth of the conditions of the world is more than our hearts feel able to bear. At times such as these, we can experience equal parts outrage, overwhelm, heartbreak, and powerlessness. Our wellspring of empathy can seem emptied, and we may feel exhausted by our concerns for the world, and the global family to which we belong. What is there to “do?”

                    Grateful Living can be most challenging when we are faced with incomprehensible pain and cruelty, but these are the moments when taking stock of the opportunities at hand can offer us greater agency. As Nelson Mandela said when he was released from 27 years in jail, “As I walked out the door…toward my freedom, I knew if I didn’t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I’d still be in prison.” Liberation and social change require action. Grateful living asks us to “stop” to experience our heart’s truth, to “look” in order to notice what resources we have at hand with which we can make a difference, and to “go” – taking action that expresses our deepest commitments to a world with peace and justice for all.

                            The Karachi Agreement of 1949 was signed by the military representatives of India and Pakistan, supervised by the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan, establishing a cease-fire line in Kashmir following the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.[1] It established a cease-fire line which has been monitored by United Nations observers from the United Nations since then.
                            The Security Council Resolution 39 of April 1948 established a UN Commission (United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan — UNCIP) to mediate between India and Pakistan in order to bring about a cessation of fighting in Kashmir and to make arrangements for a popular plebiscite.

                                The Mizoram Peace Accord, 1986 was an official agreement between the Government of India and the Mizo National Front (MNF) to end insurgency and violence in Mizoram, India, that started in 1966.[1] The Mizo National Front was an organisation of Mizo secessionists led by Laldenga to fight for independence from India. The movement was basically due to lack of support from the government during the great famine (called Mautam) in Mizoram in the late 1950s. Political insurgency and social unrest ensued in the next decades. After a number of negotiations, the document titled Mizoram Accord, 1986: Memorandum of Settlement was finally signed on 30 June 1986. It is remarked as the most and only successful peace agreement in India after its independence from British Empire in 1947.[3][4]

                                The day is commemorated as Victory Day, a national holiday, in Bangladesh; and as Vijay Diwas on the Indian military calendar.
